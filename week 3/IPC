Inter-process communication:
    Making two or more different process to communicate with each other.
    It can be done using various techniques such as pipes, queues, shared memory, sockets, semophore etc...
    Ipc is needed when different process need to communicate, share data etc...

          pipes -> one-way communication.
                   Communication between related process.
          Message queue -> message are send and received through queue.
          Shared Memory -> Multiple process can access same memory space.
          sockets -> communication of process between the network.
          semaphore -> synchronization tool(signals the next process to go in)


Synchronization:
    While one process is reading or writing shared memory, all other processes must wait until it's done.


How to choose the right IPC mechanism?
    type of data being shared.
    communication pattern.
    performance requirements.
