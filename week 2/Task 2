2. File Processing: 
      ▪ Write scripts in both Bash and Csh that loop through a directory of files and print their names.
      ▪ Compare the syntax and efficiency of both scripts.

Bash:
      for file in *.sh
      do
      	size=$(stat -c%s $file)
      	if [ $size -gt 100 ]; then
      		echo "$file"
      	else
      		echo "smaller"
      	fi
      done
