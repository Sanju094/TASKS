Write scripts in both bash and csh that define a function, accept parameters, and return a value.
Write a script that uses if/then/else, and case statements.

Bash:

            sum(){
            a=$(( $1 + $2))
            if [ $a -gt 5 ]; then
            echo "$((a+5))"
            else
            echo "$a"
            fi
            }
            
            read -p "num1: " a
            read -p "num2: " b
            result=$( sum a b )
            
            echo "result : $result"
            
            case $result in
            1)
            echo "Sunday"
            ;;
            2)
            echo "Monday"
            ;;
            3)
            echo "Tuesday"
            ;;
            4)
            echo "Wednesday"
            ;;
            5)
            echo "Thursday"
            ;;
            6)
            echo "Friday"
            ;;
            7)
            echo "Saturday"
            ;;
            *)
            echo "The value is greater than 7"
            ;;
            
            esac


csh:
            set a = $<
            set b = $<
            @ result = $a + $b
            if ( $result > 5 ) then
            	@ result = $result + 5
            endif
            
            echo "$result"
            
            switch ($result)
            case 1:
            echo "Sunday"
            breaksw
            case 2:
            echo "Monday"
            breaksw
            case 3:
            echo "Tuesday"
            breaksw
            case 4:
            echo "wednesday"
            breaksw
            case 5:
            echo "Thursday"
            breaksw
            case 6:
            echo "Friday"
            break
            case 7:
            echo "Saturday"
            breaksw
            default:
            echo "more than 7"
            exit 1
            endsw


Csh do not has the concept of functions.
