Write scripts in both Bash and Csh that prompt the user for input and perform different actions based on the input.


code.sh:
      read -p "enter the number:  " a
      aa=()
      
      if [ $a -lt 0 ]; then
      exit 1
      fi
      
      for((i = 1;i <= $a;i++))
      do
      aa+=($((a * i)))
      done
      
      echo "${aa[@]}"

In this program the if condition is the error handling which checks whether the number is positive or negative.
The input is get from the user.

output:
sanjuga@sanjuga:~$  bash code.sh
                    enter the number:   3
                    3 6 9


code.csh
        echo " Enter the number: "
        set a = $<
        
        if ($a < 0) then
        echo "it is less than 0"
        exit 1
        endif
        
        set aa = ()
        @ i = 1
        while($i <= $a)
        set aa = ($aa  `expr $a \* $i`)
        @ i++
        end
        
        echo $aa

output:
sanjuga@sanjuga:~$  csh code.csh
                    enter the number:   5
                    5 10 15 20 25



Both code has the same logic of printing the tables upto the given input number.
The difference in both the code is syntax only, the changes are given below
        reading the input from the user
        if syntax
        looping syntax
        Arithmetic operation syntax.
