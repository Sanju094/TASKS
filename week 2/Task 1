1. Basic Script Comparison: 
      ▪ Write a simple script in both Bash and Csh that prints "Hello, World!" and the current date and time.
      ▪ Compare the syntax and execution of both scripts.


hello.sh:
    c="hello world"
    echo "$c"
    echo `date` 

output:
    sanjuga@sanjuga:~$ bash hello_bash.sh
    hello world
    Mon May 19 08:37:37 PM IST 2025


hello.csh
    c = "hello world"
    echo "$c"
    echo `date`

output:
    sanjuga@sanjuga:~$ csh hello_csh.csh
    hello world
    Mon May 19 08:37:37 PM IST 2025



comparsion:
  - In both the programs I declared the variable and stored the word "hello world" in bash no space after and before the "=" symbol,
and in csh there should be a space before and after the "=".
  - In both languages to run a shell command use ``(backticks).
