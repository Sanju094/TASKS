Open both Bash and Csh shells and experiment with command history, aliasing, and tab completion.
Discuss the differences in interactive usability.

Bash:
It is the default language in linux.


ls - list all the files in the directory
pwd - print the directory in which currently we are
alias (eg : alias rithi “pwd”) - to set the name for commands
unalias - remove the name set to commands (eg: unalias rithi)
history - shows all the commands that are ran in the terminal until now.
!! - runs the previous command
!1 - runs the first command in the history
!-1 - runs the last command in the  history
head -displays the first line in the file
tail - displays the last line in the file
        top - displays information about the process for some minutes
        ps - displays information about the currently running program


Csh(Cshell)
        It is not a default language so to change the terminal to csh run the command csh in the terminal.
        Csh also have most of the commands used by bash.
        Comparing to bash csh is more interactive.
        These commands do not directly run in the csh for that we should write .cshrc file.

To run "history" command .cshrc should be written in that history can store these number of commands should be specified.

alias(alias sanju "ls -l") - keep the alias name for ls command.

fg - brings the background jobs to the foreground
bg - move the process to the background
jobs - lists the stopped and running process
setenv - set the environment variable
unsetenv - unset the environment variable
sort - sort lines of the text
